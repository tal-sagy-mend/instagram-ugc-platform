## 📝 Notes

- These are **mockups**, not a working application
- Data is static and for demonstration only
- Some interactions show alerts (this is intentional)
- Modals and forms are functional but don't save data
- Navigation between pages uses simple links

## 🎯 Next Steps

After reviewing these mockups:
1. Gather feedback from stakeholders
2. Refine designs based on feedback
3. Use as reference for actual implementation
4. Create design system based on styles used here
